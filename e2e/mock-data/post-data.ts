        The deal is one of the industry’s biggest by volume and is the most planes sold by Airbus in one batch.
        U.S. investor Bill Franke signed the agreement worth some 50 billion dollars to supply four of his airlines at the Dubai Airshow ` +
        `amid a flurry of deal making.
        The deals underscores how budget carriers are rewriting the rule book by combining bargain fares augmented by optional services ` +
        `and upgrades for which passengers pay
        additional fees.
        Airlines are also taking advantage of a recent slowdown in demand for new aircraft to negotiate competitive prices from leading ` +
        `manufacturers.
        The deal marks a dramatic turnaround for Airbus, which had been lagging behind archrival Boeing in the contest for orders so far ` +

        On the streets, it seems to be business as usual. Eyewitnesses say Zimbabweans are going about their normal day.
        Soldiers deployed across the capital and seized the state broadcaster after Mugabe’s governing Zanu-PF party accused the head of ` +
        `the military of treason.
        It comes after military chief General Constantino Chiwenga threatened to intervene to end a purge of his allies in Mugabe’s Zanu-PF.
        Chiwenga’s unprecedented statement represented a major escalation of the struggle to succeed Mugabe.
        Two hours later, soldier overran the headquarters of the ZBC, Zimbabwe’s state broadcaster and a principal Mugabe mouthpiece and ` +
        `ordered staff to leave.
        Several ZBC workers were reportedly manhandled according to two members of staff and a human rights activist.
        Shortly afterwards, three explosions rocked the centre of the southern African nation’s capital, according to witnesses.

        Arrests

        The military detained Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo on Wednesday, according to government sources.
        Chombo was a leading member of the so-called ‘G40’ faction of the ruling ZANU-PF party, led by Mugabe’s wife Grace.
        It has been vying to succeed Mugabe.

        Advice for those in Zimbabwe

        The US and the UK are advising their citizens in Harare to stay indoors because of “political uncertainty.”
        “US citizens in Zimbabwe are encouraged to shelter in place until further notice,” the US statement said.
        The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office statement told “nationals currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their ` +
        `accomodation until the situation becomes clearer.”

        The context

        Zimbabwe has been on edge since Monday when Chiwenga, Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, said he was prepared to “step in” 
        to end a purge of supporters of the sacked vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.
        Mnangagwa, a former security chief nicknamed “The Crocodile” was favourite to succeed his life-long political patron but was 
        ousted a week ago to pave the way for Mugabe’s 52-year-old wife Grace to succeed him.
        The previous day, Chiwenga had made clear the army’s refusal to accept the removal of Mnangagwa and the presumed accession of Grace.
        According to reports, Mnangagwa had been planning to revitalise the economy by bringing back thousands of white farmers kicked off 
        their land nearly two decades ago.
        He reportedly also wanted to patch up relations with international organisations like the World Bank and IMF.`
