        The deal is one of the industry’s biggest by volume and is the most planes sold by Airbus in one batch.
        U.S. investor Bill Franke signed the agreement worth some 50 billion dollars to supply four of his airlines at the Dubai Airshow amid a flurry of deal making.
        The deals underscores how budget carriers are rewriting the rule book by combining bargain fares augmented by optional services and upgrades for which passengers pay
        additional fees.
        Airlines are also taking advantage of a recent slowdown in demand for new aircraft to negotiate competitive prices from leading manufacturers.
        The deal marks a dramatic turnaround for Airbus, which had been lagging behind archrival Boeing in the contest for orders so far this year.`

    headline: `Zimbabwe’s military says it has seized power in a targeted assault on “criminals” around President Robert Mugabe who it is claimed were causing social and economic suffering.
        However, assurances have been given that the 93-year-old leader and his family are “safe and sound”.`,
    content: `Zimbabwean soldiers and armoured vehicles blocked roads to the main government offices, parliament and the courts in central Harare.
        On the streets, it seems to be business as usual. Eyewitnesses say Zimbabweans are going about their normal day.
        Soldiers deployed across the capital and seized the state broadcaster after Mugabe’s governing Zanu-PF party accused the head of the military of treason.
        It comes after military chief General Constantino Chiwenga threatened to intervene to end a purge of his allies in Mugabe’s Zanu-PF.
        Chiwenga’s unprecedented statement represented a major escalation of the struggle to succeed Mugabe.
        Two hours later, soldier overran the headquarters of the ZBC, Zimbabwe’s state broadcaster and a principal Mugabe mouthpiece and ordered staff to leave.
        Several ZBC workers were reportedly manhandled according to two members of staff and a human rights activist.
        Shortly afterwards, three explosions rocked the centre of the southern African nation’s capital, according to witnesses.
        
        Arrests

        The military detained Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo on Wednesday, according to government sources.
        Chombo was a leading member of the so-called ‘G40’ faction of the ruling ZANU-PF party, led by Mugabe’s wife Grace.
        It has been vying to succeed Mugabe.
        
        Advice for those in Zimbabwe
        
        The US and the UK are advising their citizens in Harare to stay indoors because of “political uncertainty.”
        “US citizens in Zimbabwe are encouraged to shelter in place until further notice,” the US statement said.
        The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office statement told “nationals currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their accomodation until the situation becomes clearer.”
        
        The context

        Zimbabwe has been on edge since Monday when Chiwenga, Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, said he was prepared to “step in” to end a purge of supporters of the sacked vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.
        Mnangagwa, a former security chief nicknamed “The Crocodile” was favourite to succeed his life-long political patron but was ousted a week ago to pave the way for Mugabe’s 52-year-old wife Grace to succeed him.
        The previous day, Chiwenga had made clear the army’s refusal to accept the removal of Mnangagwa and the presumed accession of Grace.
        According to reports, Mnangagwa had been planning to revitalise the economy by bringing back thousands of white farmers kicked off their land nearly two decades ago.
        He reportedly also wanted to patch up relations with international organisations like the World Bank and IMF.`

    content: `Donald Trump can currently order a nuclear missile launch without consulting Congress.
        As the US president’s Twitter rants over North Korea’s nuclear arsenal escalated, senators debated this during a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
        While some senators argued that the “military does not blindly follow orders,” including those of a military nature.
        Another said: “No one human being should have the power to unilaterally unleash the most destructive forces ever devised by humankind.”
        Who holds the power to launch nuclear attacks in other countries?
        
        Russia
        
        In Russia, Putin can decide to use the country’s nuclear arsenal.
        Little information exists on specific details of the country’s nuclear weapons programme, but open sources say Putin carries a “Cheget” (nuclear briefcase) with him, weighing nearly 11 kg along with the Minister of Defense and the Chief of the General Staff.
        In the event of a nuclear attack in the country, the three Cheget would alert their owners simultaneously.
        They are connected to a communications system code-named “Kavkaz” which allows communication between senior government officials if they needed to make a decision whether to use nuclear weapons.
        Russia also has a backup system in place called “Perimeter,” known in the US and Western Europe as the “Dead Hand”, which means a retaliatory strike with the full power of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces would be provided in the event that Chegetov carriers and command posts were disabled.
        
        North Korea
        
        Perhaps unsurprisingly, little is known about North Korea’s nuclear launch procedure, but it might be assumed that Kim Jong-un holds the power to press the big red button.`
